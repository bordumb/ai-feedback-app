Goal:
I am building an AI-powered feedback collection app that allows businesses to collect and analyze user feedback. The app consists of a Next.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a PostgreSQL database running on Docker.
Now that the basic functionality is working, I need to improve the MVP by adding database storage, AI-based categorization, a feedback dashboard, authentication, and deployment.
Below are the key improvements I need help with. Please provide detailed step-by-step guidance for implementing each feature, including necessary code updates, best practices, and any external dependencies I should consider.

🔹 1. Store Feedback in a Database (PostgreSQL)
Problem:
Right now, feedback is only processed by AI and not stored.
I need to save feedback into PostgreSQL so it can be retrieved later for analysis.

🛠️ What I Need
Set up a PostgreSQL database using Docker for persistent storage.
Modify FastAPI to store feedback when users submit it.
Allow the frontend to fetch past feedback from the database.
📍 Files to Update
database/schema.sql → Define the feedback table (id, user_input, category, sentiment, timestamp).
backend/app/models/database.py → Connect FastAPI to PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy.
backend/app/api/routes/feedback.py → Update the API to save and retrieve feedback.



🔹 2. Improve AI Feedback Processing
Problem:
Right now, the AI randomly categorizes feedback instead of using a real model.
I need to implement a real AI model for:

Categorization (e.g., usability, design, performance).
Sentiment Analysis (positive, neutral, negative).
Summarization of recurring issues.
🛠️ What I Need
Replace the placeholder AI logic with a real AI model (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, Scikit-learn).
Implement NLP techniques for categorizing and analyzing user feedback.
Optimize AI performance so it runs efficiently in the backend.
📍 Files to Update
backend/app/services/ai_feedback.py → Replace random logic with a real AI-based model.
💡 Questions
Which AI model should I use for feedback categorization & sentiment analysis?
Should I use a pre-trained model (Hugging Face, OpenAI) or train my own?
How can I optimize performance & response time for real-time analysis?


🔹 3. Add a Dashboard to View Feedback
Problem:
Right now, users can submit feedback, but there is no way to view past submissions.
I need to create a dashboard where users can see a list of all submitted feedback, including category & sentiment analysis.

🛠️ What I Need
Create a new /dashboard page in Next.js.
Fetch feedback from the database using the FastAPI backend.
Display feedback in a table with:
ID
User Input
Category
Sentiment
Timestamp
Allow filtering & sorting (e.g., show only "Negative" feedback).
📍 Files to Update
frontend/src/pages/dashboard.tsx → Build the feedback dashboard UI.
frontend/src/api/index.ts → Add API call to fetch stored feedback.
💡 Questions
What table component should I use in Next.js for displaying feedback?
How can I implement filtering & sorting in the UI?


🔹 4. Add Authentication (Login System)
Problem:
Right now, anyone can submit feedback, which isn’t ideal for businesses.
I need to add authentication so that only authorized users can manage feedback.

🛠️ What I Need
User authentication system (JWT-based login/logout).
Admin dashboard access (Admins can view/manage feedback).
Frontend login page for users to sign in.
📍 Files to Update
backend/app/auth/ → Add JWT-based authentication to FastAPI.
frontend/src/pages/auth.tsx → Create a login UI in Next.js.
💡 Questions
Should I store tokens in HTTP-only cookies or localStorage?
How can I secure API routes so that only logged-in users can access the dashboard?


🔹 5. Deploy the App (Cloud Hosting)
Problem:
Right now, the app only runs locally. I need to deploy it so businesses can use it online.

🛠️ What I Need
Deploy frontend (Next.js)

Vercel (Best for Next.js)
Netlify (Easy deployment)
Deploy backend (FastAPI)

Railway.app (Simple FastAPI hosting)
Render.com (Good free tier)
AWS/GCP (Production scaling)
💡 Questions
What’s the best deployment strategy for this project?
How can I set up a production database (PostgreSQL) in the cloud?
Should I use Docker for deployment or just deploy FastAPI & Next.js separately?
